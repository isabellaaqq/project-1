      <h1>He halted in the wind, and — what was that</h1>
      <h2>Far in the maples, pale, but not a ghost?</h2>
      <h3>He stood there bringing March against his thought,</h3>
      <h4>And yet too ready to believe the most.</h4>
      <h5>“Oh, that’s the Paradise-in-bloom,” I said;</h5>
      <h6>And truly it was fair enough for flowers</h6>
      <h7>had we but in us to assume in march</h7>
      <h8>Such white luxuriance of May for ours.</h8>
      <h9>We stood a moment so in a strange world,</h9>
      <h10>Myself as one his own pretense deceives;</h10>
      <h11>And then I said the truth (and we moved on).</h11>
      <h12>A young beech clinging to its last year’s leaves.</h12>
